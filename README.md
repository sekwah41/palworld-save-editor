# Palworld save editor

This is just a quick project I created to mess around with the palworld saves as I wanted to save players progress after I had reverted to a backup.

Initially this will just be a simple save editor, but I may add more features in the future e.g. copying inventory from a backup file, converting a single player world to a dedicated etc.
