# Palworld Save Editor

This is just a quick project I created to mess around with the Palworld saves as I was having a couple of troubles.

I have no plans currently to add extra features though will review any if people want to add them. Also, if something seems like a fun challenge I may also have a go.

This project cant currently decode the while file so additional types will need to be added or logic to properly decode them, while im not sure if ill continue the project I may take a look at it for fun at some point.

This project currently uses uesave-rs to read and write the save files.

I tend to make a lot of random tools for myself so if you would like this project to be continued, please let me know by creating an issue, discussion or messaging me on discord (I'm in the palworld discord server).

For large level files it can take quite a while to open, though it should eventually become responsive :)
